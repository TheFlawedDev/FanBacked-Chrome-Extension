## Acknowledgments
- **Inspiration**: I've known that looking at YouTube descriptions for creator discount codes is a hassle, sometimes those same links
are only available on their social media platforms. And as someone who shops on my computer, I thought why not have something
to ease the pain of searching for those links. What also came to mind was the fact that people do alot of shopping, and
people wouldn't mind using an affiliate link even if they got no discount from it as long as someone they knew got something from it.
So why not this? We can help each other from time to time, sometimes my favorate creator has a discount code which saves me money on
my purchases, sometimes they have a partnership were I am making a purchase and all i have to do is click on a link all within the
confort of my browser. No more link diving.
